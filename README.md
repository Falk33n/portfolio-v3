# 💻 Tim Falk's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m **Tim Falk**, a passionate **Fullstack Developer** specializing in modern web development using the **T3 Stack** (TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, tRPC) as well as **.NET** and **C#** for backend solutions. I’m dedicated to building high-quality, scalable web applications with a focus on performance, clean code, and accessibility.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Expertise

Here’s a glimpse of the technologies I use to bring ideas to life:

### Frontend:

- **TypeScript**: My go-to language for clean, maintainable, and type-safe code.
- **React**: I create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with hooks, context, and modern state management.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Customizable and responsive styling made easy with utility-first CSS.
- **Accessibility (WCAG)**: Web apps should be usable by everyone, and accessibility is a priority in my work.

### Backend:

- **Node.js & Express**: Powering scalable backends for RESTful APIs and real-time applications.
- **tRPC**: Typesafe API development for seamless client-server communication.
- **Prisma**: Efficient ORM for database management with automatic migrations and type safety.
- **.NET & C#**: Building robust, enterprise-level applications with a focus on API-driven architectures and microservices.

### Databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: My go-to relational database for scalable solutions.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight and efficient for smaller projects.
- **SQL Server**: Leveraging it for enterprise-level .NET applications.

### Tools & Platforms:

- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Docker**: Containerized environments for consistent development and deployment.
- **Vercel**: Fast, serverless deployment for Next.js applications.
- **Azure**: Cloud-based services for scaling .NET apps and server infrastructure.
